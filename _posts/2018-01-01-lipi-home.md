Over the last few years, researchers and practitioners have found in **Generative Adversarial Networks** (GANs) a tool to address several challenging machine learning problems.
Most of these problems are related to generative machine learning, but we can find others like semi-supervised learning tacked to create classifiers by using few labeled data samples.
Despite its success, GAN training presents several limitiations or pathologies. The most commonly observed ones are:
+ *mode collapse*: the generator can only generate one mode of the distribution
+ *discriminator collapse*: the discriminator can not discriminate any modes, and
+ *vanishing gradients*: there are no training gradients, i.e. one adversary is too strong/weak.




At **[Anyscale Learning For All (ALFA)](http://alfagroup.csail.mit.edu/)**, we have designed and developed **Lipizzaner** framework, which applies **spatially distributed co-evolution** to
        provide **resilient and robust GAN training**.

The main advantages of using Lipizzaner to train GANs are:
+ **Fast convergence** due to gradient-based steps
+ **Improved convergence** due to hyperparameter evolution
+ **Diverse sample generation** due to mixture evolution
+ **Scalability** due to spatial distribution topology and asynchronous parallelism
+ **Robustness and resilience**



There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you've gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!

As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.


## Special formatting

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*


## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
